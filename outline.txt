outline:

-Histograms to get idea of group locations,
	use ppois to get probability of groups that look large.
	Eyeball different bin sizes to get various depictions of data/groups

-Sliding window to help prevent groups from being cut in pieces by the binning
	of the histogram

-dpois to get point-probability of grouping for different bin sizes, graph it
	with x axis=group size and y axis = probability density and include bars
	where it becomes improbable that the group of that size was due to chance

-overlay sliding window over histograms to compare them, and then add line where
	group is improbable based off the dpois that we just calculated and graphed.
	(note that only 2 histogram bars rise up to meet the improbable line,
	but a few spikes in the sliding window analysis reach up to it that were
	invisible in the histogram)

-use pgamma to find proximity probability of different sizes of groups of palindromes,
	ie. the probability that "the following LAG/SHAPE palindromes are as close to a head palindrome is under .01/.05" and how the .01 ones suggest more improbable clustering.
